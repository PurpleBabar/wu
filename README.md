A good purpose, high-control, high-level language. 

## syntax

A full walk-through of the language can be found over at the [wu-lang documentation](https://wu-lang.github.io/wu.html).

### a decent language

The whole Wu language is highly inspired by low-level languages Rust and Jai, while remaining to be a high-level scripting language.
